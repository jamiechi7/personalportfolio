        <h1>Cafe Jamie – Project Summary</h1>
        <p>
          Cafe Jamie is a creative spinoff of a personal portfolio site that represents and combines my personal and professional passions for business, analytics,
          travel, and art into a cozy, cafe-inspired digital space. This is my Project Summary that explains the topic,
          purpose, and key features I implemented for my TAC 104 final project.
        </p>

      <section class="summary-section">
        <h2>Topic &amp; Purpose of the Site</h2>
        <p>
          The topic of my site is a personal portfolio framed as a digital, interactive cafe, “Cafe Jamie.”
          Instead of a traditional portfolio layout, each section of my background and personal experiences is treated like a menu item or
          dedicated section of the cafe:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Academic Projects</strong> – case studies, decks, and class/club projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Travel Diaries</strong> – photo-driven stories from trips in Asia and the U.S.</li>
          <li><strong>Fine Art Works</strong> – a small gallery of illustrations and paintings.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact / CV</strong> – ways to get in touch and a link to my resume.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The purpose of the site is to showcase my work in a way that feels personal and cohesive,
          while practicing modern, responsive web design techniques from this course. The cafe theme is my attempt to
          tie together my academic and professional experience with my personal hobbies in one branded experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Features Implemented</h2>
        <p>
          Across the homepage and four main subpages—Academic Projects, Travel Diaries, Fine Art Works, and Contact / CV—I implemented the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Multi-page layout:</strong> separate HTML pages for the homepage, Academic
            Projects, Travel Diaries, Fine Art Works, Contact / CV, plus individual photo gallery
            pages for different travel locations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistent cafe-inspired design:</strong> shared color palette, typography, and
            top navigation bar to visually connect all pages and ensure a seamless user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsive design:</strong> use of flexible grids and media queries so card
            layouts/tabs (projects, travel spots, and art pieces) adjust from multicolumn on desktops to single
            column on smaller screens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive cards with hover effects:</strong> project, travel spot, and art piece cards
            integrate subtle hover animations (lift and shadow) to increase the UI's interactivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Image galleries for travel entries:</strong> each major location in the Travel
            Diaries page links to its own gallery page that displays a set of photos in a grid format.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML structure:</strong> used variation of headings, sections, lists, and alt text
            to keep content readable and accessible for users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meta descriptions and meaningful page titles:</strong> each page includes a
            descriptive &lt;title&gt; and &lt;meta name="description"&gt; to explain its purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistent footer “refill” messaging:</strong> playful footer text (e.g., “Feeling like a
            refill?”) that reinforces the cafe theme and guides users back to the homepage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="summary-section">
        <h2>Plugins / External Libraries</h2>
        <p>
          This project does not rely on any external plugins or JavaScript libraries. All layout,
          styling, and interactivity are implemented using HTML and CSS only, plus my shared
          <code>styles.css</code> file for consistent styling across pages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="summary-section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Building Cafe Jamie helped me practice planning a multi-page site, developing a consistent
          visual interface, and thinking/brainstorming how content and navigation work together and are vital to ensure a cohesive user experience.
          The final result culminates in my personal portfolio where I aim to create a personal, creative brand in the form of an inviting cafe menu instead of a
          traditional resume site, and it can be expanded with more projects, trips, and artwork in the future as I continue building, working, and exploring.
